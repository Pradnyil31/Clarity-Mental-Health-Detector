# Gemini AI Setup Instructions

Your Flutter app has been updated to use Google's Gemini AI model for chat functionality with emotion analysis. Here's how to set it up:

## Getting Your Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Get API key" in the left sidebar
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the API key

## Setting Up the API Key in Your App

1. Open your Flutter app
2. Navigate to the AI Chat screen
3. Tap the menu button (three dots) in the top right
4. Select "Gemini Settings"
5. Paste your API key and tap "Save API Key"

## Features

Your new Gemini-powered chat includes:

- **Emotion Analysis**: The app detects emotions in your messages and provides contextually appropriate responses
- **Advanced AI**: Powered by Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model for high-quality conversations
- **Mental Health Focus**: Specifically configured to provide supportive, empathetic responses for mental health conversations
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintains context throughout your conversation
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in monitoring to ensure the AI service is working properly

## How It Works

1. **You type a message** → The app analyzes your emotion using the existing emotion detection service
2. **Emotion context is added** → Your message is enhanced with emotional context (e.g., "User is feeling sad with 85% confidence")
3. **Gemini responds** → The AI provides an empathetic, contextually appropriate response
4. **Conversation continues** → The AI maintains context for natural, flowing conversations

## Example Conversation

**You**: "I'm feeling really overwhelmed with work lately"
**Emotion Detected**: Stress (87% confidence)
**Gemini**: "I can sense the stress in your message, and I want you to know that feeling overwhelmed with work is completely understandable. Many people experience this, especially when responsibilities pile up. What aspects of work are weighing on you the most right now?"

## Troubleshooting

- **"Failed to initialize Gemini AI"**: Make sure you've entered a valid API key in the settings
- **Empty responses**: Check your internet connection and API key validity
- **Slow responses**: This is normal for AI processing; responses typically take 2-5 seconds

## Privacy & Security

- Your API key is stored securely on your device
- Conversations are sent to Google's Gemini API for processing
- No conversation data is permanently stored by the app
- You can clear your API key anytime in the settings

Enjoy your new AI-powered mental health companion! 🤖💙
